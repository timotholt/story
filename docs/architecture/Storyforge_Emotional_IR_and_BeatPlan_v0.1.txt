STORYFORGE EMOTIONAL IR & BEAT PLAN v0.1
Status: Canonical (Execution Support)
Scope: execution-support (medium-agnostic)

============================================================
1. PURPOSE
============================================================

This document defines the Emotional Intermediate Representation (Emotional IR)
used by Storyforge to model audience-facing emotional flow independently of medium.

The Emotional IR describes:
- what the audience is allowed to believe
- when that belief is violated
- what cost is paid
- what meaning becomes constrained

It does NOT:
- specify timing, panels, pages, or minutes
- dictate rendering style
- replace canon or user intent

============================================================
2. CORE PRINCIPLE
============================================================

Meaning precedes medium.

The Emotional IR is invariant across render targets.
Medium-specific scheduling maps Emotional IR beats into slots.

============================================================
3. EMOTIONAL BEAT TYPES (ORDERED)
============================================================

An EmotionalBeatPlan MUST be an ordered sequence.
Minimum viable plan is 4 beats.

Allowed beat types:

1) INGRESS_EXPECTATION_LOCK
2) MISDIRECTION_LOCK (optional)
3) UNEXPECTED_TURN_VIOLATION
4) COST_PAYMENT
5) SMD_LOCK (Scene Meaning Delta)
6) EXIT_RESIDUE

============================================================
4. INGRESS COMPLETION (OPERATIONAL)
============================================================

Ingress is COMPLETE only when:
- the audience has time to form an expectation
- no core conflict or revelation has occurred

Ingress is enforced by forbidden actions, not captions.

============================================================
5. TRACEABILITY REQUIREMENTS
============================================================

Each beat MUST specify:
- audience_belief_before
- audience_belief_after
- required_anchor_type

============================================================
6. FAILURE CONDITIONS
============================================================

An EmotionalBeatPlan is INVALID if:
- conflict precedes ingress completion
- UT does not violate a belief
- cost is invisible
- SMD does not constrain future possibility

============================================================
END OF EMOTIONAL IR
