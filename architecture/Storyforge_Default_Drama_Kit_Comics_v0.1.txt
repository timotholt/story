Storyforge Default Drama Kit - Comics
Version: v0.1 Date: 2026-01-08 Status: Canonical (Base Package)
Purpose: Provide a default, comic-book-oriented set of relationship axes and goal vectors that reliably generates
high-contrast drama without constraining genre-specific extensions.
Precedence: Subordinate to workspace-law (Storyforge_Workspace_Canon_Rules_v0.1.txt) and higher canonical
contracts. This kit never overrides explicit user-supplied SceneRequest or loaded Character Canon prohibitions.

1. Scope and binding behavior
This document defines default relationship axis vocabulary and default goal vector vocabulary for
comic-book style scenes. It is a default kit: it applies only when required fields are missing, and it is
designed to reduce flat scenes by forcing legible pressure, reversals, and costs.
DK-001 (Default-Only): Use this kit only to fill missing relationship axes or character goals. If the user
supplies them, obey the user.
DK-002 (Extensible): Additional axes and goals may be added as free strings; this kit defines a stable
core set, not a closed enum.
DK-003 (No Canon Override): Diagnostic numbers (if used) are informational. They MUST NOT override
explicit canon prohibitions or required behaviors.
DK-004 (Auditability): If defaults are applied, you MUST record what you filled and why (see Section 5).

2. Default Relationship Axis Set (Core 12)
These 12 axis keys are the canonical default vocabulary for RelationshipEntry.conceptual_axes when a
comic scene needs relationship pressure. Each axis is defined by two poles; scenes should indicate
direction via before/after language and on-page signals.

Key (string) | Poles | What it measures | Typical comic signals
--- | --- | --- | ---
dominance | dominance <-> submission | who can force outcomes now | orders, pins, humiliations
leverage | leverage <-> exposure | who holds damaging info/advantage | threats, receipts, blackmail
trust | trust <-> suspicion | belief in intentions/claims | tests, accusations, double-checking
truth | truth <-> deception | how much is hidden/manipulated | lies, omissions, misdirection
alignment | aligned <-> betrayal-risk | side-taking and loyalty stability | offers, defections, ultimatums
closeness | closeness <-> distance | emotional access and vulnerability | confessions, shutouts
desire | desire <-> disgust | magnetism (romantic/sexual/aesthetic) | flirt, recoil, temptation
respect | respect <-> contempt | regard for competence/dignity | praise, belittling, contempt
empathy | empathy <-> cruelty | willingness to spare vs harm | mercy, twisting the knife
hatred | affection <-> hatred | raw valence (love-hate heat) | tenderness, venom, rage
vengeance | mercy <-> vengeance | retribution pressure vs restraint | payback, restraint, bargains
volatility | stability <-> volatility | likelihood of escalation/flip | impulses, snap turns

DK-AX-010 (Primary/Secondary selection): For each scene, select 3 Primary axes and 2 Secondary
axes from the Core 12. Primary axes MUST be referenced in planning and MUST visibly move in the
rendered scene.
DK-AX-020 (Reversal requirement): At least 1 Primary axis MUST reverse direction at or near the
turning-point INU (e.g., suspicion->trust, mercy->vengeance, dominance->submission).
DK-AX-030 (INU anchoring): Each Primary axis move MUST be represented by at least one INURecord
with delta_type=relationship (or power when appropriate) and a perceptible_anchor that the renderer can
show on-page.

3. Default Goal Vector Set (Core 10)
This kit defines a default vocabulary of character goal vectors, suitable for mapping into
DriveEntry.drive_name when explicit goals are missing. These are forces, not tasks.

Key (drive_name string) | What it means | Common comic collisions
--- | --- | ---
protect | keep a person/place/secret safe | duty vs desire; sacrifice
gain_power | increase ability/influence/resources | envy, arms race, corruption
keep_power | retain status/control; avoid dethroning | paranoia, purges, coercion
uncover_truth | learn what happened; expose reality | secrets, betrayal, institutions
hide_truth | keep identity/act/weakness concealed | lies vs intimacy; cover-ups
win_love | start or restore a bond | triangles, rivals, fear of rejection
keep_love | prevent abandonment; hold the bond | control vs trust; tests
justice | punish wrongdoing / stop harm | ends vs means; moral injury
revenge | make them pay; settle the score | escalation; collateral damage
identity | become/accept the self; reject a role | mask vs self; destiny vs choice

DK-GO-010 (Per-character minimum): If character goals are missing, assign each character at least two
DriveEntries: one primary_goal (from Core 10) and one shadow_goal (also from Core 10, often in
tension with the primary).
DK-GO-020 (Goal collision): The scene Spine Conflict MUST be expressible as a collision between
primary goals, constrained by the selected Primary axes.
DK-GO-030 (Hidden intent): At least one character SHOULD pursue a goal that is not stated openly in
dialogue (shadow goal), creating deception, leverage, or moral pressure.

4. Default application protocol
DK-AP-010 (When to apply): Apply this kit during Phase -1 (CanonInitializationPack) when relationship
axes or character goal drives are required for planning/validation and not supplied by the user or existing
canon.
DK-AP-020 (How to apply):
1) Identify the scene's likely spine conflict (from SceneRequest).
2) Select 3 Primary axes + 2 Secondary axes from Core 12 that will best amplify that conflict.
3) For each character, assign primary_goal + shadow_goal from Core 10 (DriveEntry.drive_name).
4) Ensure at least one Primary axis can plausibly reverse by the turning point.
5) Record defaults applied per Section 5.

5. DefaultsAppliedReport (audit record)
Core contracts do not define a dedicated DefaultsAppliedReport artifact. To keep the system stable, this kit
defines a structured record that MUST be embedded in CanonInitializationPack.notes when defaults are
applied.

DK-AU-010 (Embedding): When defaults are applied, set CanonInitializationPack.notes to a string
containing the JSON object below (exact keys).
DefaultsAppliedReport (embedded in CanonInitializationPack.notes) { "kit_id":
"Storyforge_Default_Drama_Kit_Comics", "kit_version": "v0.1", "applied_in_phase": "-1",
"filled": { "relationship_axes": { "primary": ["string", "string", "string"],
"secondary": ["string", "string"], "rationale": "string" }, "character_goals": [ {
"character_id": "string", "primary_goal": "string", "shadow_goal": "string", "notes":
null } ] }, "overrides_respected": ["string"] }

DK-AU-020 (No silent drift): Do not revise previously recorded defaults inside the same scene window
unless a ValidationReport RepairDirective explicitly permits Phase -1 changes.
DK-AU-030 (Do not overwrite): If any field is present (user-supplied axes, drives, relationship baselines),
do not overwrite it. Only fill missing items.

6. Compatibility notes
- This kit uses existing canonical fields: RelationshipEntry.conceptual_axes and
CanonInitializationPack.drives (DriveEntry). It does not require schema changes.
- Axis keys and goal keys are stable strings intended for consistent reuse across sessions and UI tooling.
- Render-only repair (Phase PR) MUST NOT change selected axes, goals, spine conflict, or INURecords.
