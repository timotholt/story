Storyforge Comics Default Presets Kit
Version: v0.1 | Date: 2026-01-08

Purpose: Provide small, comic-mode-friendly default presets that reduce flat scenes without changing
any core engine schemas. This kit is defaults-only and never overrides user or higher-canon inputs.

Scope: Applied only when output_mode = Comic and the user has not supplied the relevant details.
Presets are referenced via tokens appended to existing string-list fields (e.g.,
SceneRequestSpec.constraints / SceneContract.constraints) so no schema changes are required.

Non-Override Rule: If the user specifies any of the preset topics (panel count, violence boundary,
resistance quotas, etc.), those user values win. This kit only fills omissions.

1. Canon Safety and Application Contract
This document is a base package. It does not supersede workspace-law or core contracts. If any
conflict exists, higher authority wins.
• CPK-AP-010 (Defaults-only): Apply presets only for missing details and only when output_mode is
Comic.
• CPK-AP-020 (No schema changes): Record preset usage by appending tokens into existing string-list
fields: SceneRequestSpec.constraints and/or SceneContract.constraints.
• CPK-AP-030 (No silent drift): Do not revise applied preset choices inside the same scene window
unless a ValidationReport RepairDirective explicitly permits a change.
• CPK-AP-040 (Minimum footprint): Prefer the smallest preset that resolves the omission (do not
over-specify).

Preset Tokens: When a preset is applied, add tokens like the following:
PRESET:ComicsDefaultsKit/v0.1:CPK-LS-010
PRESET:ComicsDefaultsKit/v0.1:CPK-RP-020
Tokens may be grouped as a comma-separated suffix in a single constraint string if list space is limited.

2. Low-Stakes Scene Defaults (Comic Mode)
Use these only when the user has not specified them and they are needed for clarity, staging, or
pressure. These defaults should never change the scene's meaning.

2.1 Time, Light, and Crowd
• CPK-LS-010 (Time-of-day): Default to late afternoon or early evening if unspecified (best for readable
light and crowd presence).
• CPK-LS-020 (Lighting): Default to high-contrast readable lighting (clear silhouettes, readable eyes).
• CPK-LS-030 (Crowd): Default to a small audience/witness set (3-12) unless privacy is required by the
conflict.

2.2 Comic-Standard Micro-Locations
• CPK-LS-040 (Hero urban): rooftop edge, alley mouth, fire escape landing, subway platform,
newsroom bullpen.
• CPK-LS-050 (School): cafeteria line, hallway corner near lockers, gym bleachers, courtyard steps.
• CPK-LS-060 (Authority): precinct hallway, interrogation room window, hospital corridor, lab bay.

2.3 Default Props for Pressure and Legibility
• CPK-LS-070: Evidence prop (photo, phone clip, envelope, torn note) when leverage/exposure is
active.
• CPK-LS-080: Constraint prop (broken strap, dead phone, cracked mask) when scarcity or vulnerability
is active.
• CPK-LS-090: Social prop (badge, clipboard, mic, camera) when status/authority is active.

3. ResistancePlan Presets (Comic Pacing)
These presets exist to prevent 'easy agreement' and to enforce visible back-and-forth before the hinge.
They are compatible with the core rule: turning-point INU is forbidden until quotas are satisfied.

3.1 Size Presets
Preset ID | When to use | Minimum quotas before hinge | Notes
--- | --- | --- | ---
CPK-RP-010 (Small) | 1-page feel / short exchange | 2 blocks + 1 clamp | Clamp must impose a cost or a constraint shift
CPK-RP-020 (Medium) | 2-3 page feel / standard scene | 3 blocks + 1 clamp + 1 cost spike | Cost spike must be visible in render.
CPK-RP-030 (Large) | set-piece confrontation | 4 blocks + 2 clamps + 1 counterplay beat | Counterplay = opponent changes tactic after resistance

3.2 Clamp Menu (choose at least one)
• CPK-RP-110 (Witness clamp): someone is watching; stakes shift to reputation.
• CPK-RP-120 (Time clamp): deadline compresses choices.
• CPK-RP-130 (Resource clamp): loss of tool, phone, exit, mask, money, or cover story.
• CPK-RP-140 (Moral clamp): to win, you must cross a line (or refuse and pay).

4. Stakes and Cost Ladder (Comic Legibility)
When resistance rises, cost should rise. This kit provides a default ladder that helps keep scenes from
resolving cleanly. Use it as guidance; do not invent irreversible canon beyond what the core engine
permits.

4.1 Cost Levels
• CPK-CL-010 (Social): embarrassment, credibility loss, public humiliation, rumor ignition.
• CPK-CL-020 (Relational): trust fracture, boundary violation, withdrawal, allegiance wobble.
• CPK-CL-030 (Tactical): lost leverage, exposed tell, trapped position, gave up advantage.
• CPK-CL-040 (Physical): pain, fatigue, minor injury, damaged gear.
• CPK-CL-050 (Moral): crossed a line, collateral harm, self-betrayal, stain that persists.

CPK-CL-100 (Escalation rule): In Comic mode, default to a monotonic trend: each block should
increase cost level or deepen the same cost in a new way until the hinge.

5. Unexpected Turn (UT) Chooser for Comics
UT is required by core contract. This section provides default heuristics for selecting UT types that read
clearly on the page.

5.1 Default UT-by-Scene-Type
• CPK-UT-010 (Romance / intimacy): reveal or value_shift (secret identity pressure; misread motives).
• CPK-UT-020 (Power play / rivalry): competence_shift or reversal (someone wins a beat the other
assumed).
• CPK-UT-030 (Mystery / investigation): reveal or constraint_snap (new evidence collapses a plan).
• CPK-UT-040 (Team fracture): refusal or betrayal-risk spike (alignment axis snaps).
• CPK-UT-050 (Hero vs villain): cost_spike or third_force only if pre-declared.

CPK-UT-100 (Testability rule): UT must be falsifiable in planning and then perceptible in render (a
reader can point to it).

6. Comic Output Mode Grammar Defaults
These defaults apply only to the rendering presentation (Phase 4). They may not change upstream
meaning or state.

6.1 Panels and Beat Rhythm
• CPK-CG-010 (Panel count): Default to 5-8 panels for a single scene unless user requests otherwise.
• CPK-CG-020 (Hinge spotlight): Give the turning-point INU its own panel (or a clear panel transition).
• CPK-CG-030 (Reaction beat): After hinge, include at least one reaction panel that shows cost and
constraint.

6.2 Captions, Balloons, and SFX
• CPK-CG-040: Captions are for framing or internal turn; balloons are for conflict. Do not over-caption.
• CPK-CG-050: Use SFX sparingly (1-3 total) and only when it adds pressure or cost salience.

6.3 Page-Turn Micro-Cliff (Optional)
• CPK-CG-060: If the scene is long enough, end the penultimate panel with a question, threat, or
reveal-beat that forces the next panel to answer it.

7. Render Signals (Only When User Requests 'Punch' or Template)
If the user requests tighter, punchier, more 'screenwriting-template' enforcement, apply these
definitions for Comic mode. Otherwise, do not impose signal quotas beyond core requirements.

7.1 Definitions
• CPK-RS-010 (Button line): a short closing line that lands a beat (threat, vow, sting, promise).
• CPK-RS-020 (Blade line): <= 10 words, cuts or exposes (insult, truth, ultimatum).
• CPK-RS-030 (Reversal event): a clear flip in advantage, belief, or constraint (not mere mood).
• CPK-RS-040 (Deflection humor): humor used to dodge pressure; must be punished by resistance if
used.

7.2 Default Minimal Quotas (only if triggered)
• CPK-RS-110: button_lines_min = 2-4
• CPK-RS-120: blade_lines_min = 2-4
• CPK-RS-130: reversal_events_min = 1-2
• CPK-RS-140: deflection_humor_min = 0-2
