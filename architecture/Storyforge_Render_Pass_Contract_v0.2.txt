STORYFORGE RENDER PASS CONTRACT
Version: v0.2
Status: Canonical (Execution Support)
Scope: execution-support (render governance)
Applies To: Phase 4 (Rendering) and PR (Post-Render Quality)

PURPOSE
Centralize rendering governance so that:
- Rendering is strictly downstream and non-semantic.
- Rendering may improve delivery (clarity, compression, voice, staging) WITHOUT changing meaning.
- Any attempt or pressure to introduce new meaning is detected and rejected deterministically.

AUTHORITY & NON-CONFLICT
- Subordinate to Storyforge_Workspace_Canon_Rules_v0.3.txt (workspace-law).
- Compatible with Storyforge_Core_Engine_Contract_v1.6.
- Does NOT redefine output-mode grammars or formatting schemas.
- Where conflict exists, higher authority wins.

DEFINITIONS
Meaning includes any change to:
- Facts, props, witnesses, locations, resources
- Motives, secrets, reveals, causal links
- INURecords, axes, goals, spine conflict, costs
- Beat order, hinge placement, or RealityLedgerDelta

Delivery includes:
- Wording, cadence, clarity, compression
- Staging emphasis of already-existing anchors
- Removal of redundancy or filler
- Voice differentiation without new facts

HARD RULE
Rendering MUST NOT change meaning.

PASS ORDER (NON-SKIPPABLE)
1. Meaning-Locked Draft Realization
2. Voice & Rhythm (delivery only)
3. Compression & Clarity (delivery only)
4. Punch-Up & Staging Emphasis (delivery only)
5. Output Conformance Check (format only)

ALLOWED EDIT CLASSES
- Syntax, diction, cadence
- Paragraphing and line breaks
- Removing redundancy
- Clarifying speaker attribution already implied
- Emphasizing existing resistance or cost

FORBIDDEN EDIT CLASSES
- Adding or altering facts, actions, or outcomes
- Inventing beats or reordering beats
- Changing axes, goals, or costs
- Editing INUs or meaning deltas
- Introducing new props, witnesses, or motives

RENDER DRIFT GATE
If new meaning is detected at any pass:
- STOP immediately
- Emit FAIL_RENDER_DRIFT
- Emit SUGGESTIONS_FOR_UPSTREAM
- Do NOT emit a best-effort render

SUGGESTIONS_FOR_UPSTREAM
When rendering requires missing ingredients, emit:
- missing_ingredient
- why_needed
- safest_upstream_phase
- suggested_artifact
- risk_if_injected_in_render

DIAGNOSTICS
Rendering MAY compute diagnostics (redundancy, voice collision, exposition density,
hinge spotlight clarity, staging clarity) for reporting only.
Diagnostics MUST NOT override canon or permit meaning edits.
