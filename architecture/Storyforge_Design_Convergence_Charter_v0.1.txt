STORYFORGE DESIGN CONVERGENCE CHARTER v0.1
Status: Design-Only
Scope: design_only
Applies To: System evolution and architecture decisions

============================================================
1. PURPOSE
============================================================

This document defines the constructive direction toward which
the Storyforge system must converge.

It does NOT govern runtime behavior.
It does NOT override the Kernel Contract.
It must be ignored during SceneRuns.

============================================================
2. CORE GOAL
============================================================

Storyforge exists to reliably construct stories that exhibit:

- clear turning points
- perceptible meaning shifts
- accumulating constraints across scenes
- low narrative mush across runs

The system is optimized for construction, not rejection.

============================================================
3. CONVERGENCE DEFINITION
============================================================

“Better stories” in Storyforge means:

- Readers can identify where the story changed.
- Meaning shifts are inferable from on-page evidence.
- Each scene narrows future possibility space.
- Structural clarity increases across iterations.

No taste judgments are implied.

============================================================
4. CONVERGENCE LADDER (PRIORITY ORDER)
============================================================

When resolving ambiguity, prefer designs that:

P1. Increase determinism and auditability
P2. Increase structural clarity of turns and costs
P3. Reduce LLM discretionary scheduling
P4. Preserve creative freedom within structure
P5. Minimize conceptual complexity

Higher priorities override lower ones.

============================================================
5. CONSTRUCTIVE DESIGN LOOP
============================================================

All system changes must follow:

1) Identify a recurring failure mode
2) Define the structural objective
3) Choose the smallest enforceable mechanism
4) Add an audit hook
5) Add a regression test

============================================================
6. BIAS TOWARD CONSTRUCTION
============================================================

When choosing between:
- conservative safety
- strong structural clarity

Prefer clarity.

The system should make bold, legible commitments.

============================================================
7. FIRST-CLASS CITIZEN BUDGET
============================================================

New first-class concepts are allowed only if they are:
- deterministic
- auditable
- non-overlapping
- phase-local

Otherwise, downgrade to diagnostics or render hints.

============================================================
8. NON-INTERFERENCE RULE
============================================================

This document MUST NOT:
- affect scene output
- affect validation
- affect rendering
- be used as justification during execution

============================================================
