1. RENDER WEAKNESS REPORT (NEW)
RP-RW-010: After Phase 4, emit RenderWeaknessReport.
RP-RW-020: Report is diagnostic-only and canon-safe.

Schema:
RenderWeaknessReport {
  total_score_0_100: int,
  weakness_class: NONE | DELIVERY | MEANING,
  recommended_route: POLISH_ONLY | MEANING_REPAIR,
  subscores_0_10: {
    axis_legibility,
    turning_point_clarity,
    resistance,
    cost_escalation,
    character_voice,
    goal_pressure,
    staging_clarity,
    compression,
    emotional_heat,
    mode_grammar
  },
  weakest_factors: [ { factor, score, class, evidence, rule_refs } ]
}

2. ROUTING RULES
RP-RW-200: DELIVERY ⇒ allow PR polish-only pass.
RP-RW-210: MEANING ⇒ forbid PR; require upstream repair + validation.
RP-RW-220: NONE ⇒ stop iteration.

3. PR CONSTRAINT
RP-PR-010: PR may only adjust presentation, clarity, compression, and staging emphasis.
RP-PR-020: PR MUST NOT change meaning, INUs, canon, axes, goals, costs, or UT.
