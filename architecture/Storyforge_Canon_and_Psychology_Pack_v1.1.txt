Storyforge Canon and Psychology Pack
Version: v1.1 • Date: 2026-01-08

Canonical constraints for characters, relationships, drives/neglect, and epistemic/commitment models.
Binds all phases and all output modes.

Change summary (v1.0 → v1.1)
- Expands CanonInitializationPack schemas (no “...” placeholders).
- Clarifies: numeric scalars are diagnostics; they must not override canonical prohibitions.
- No behavioral changes; this is a completeness + clarity update.

1. Authority and scope
This pack defines canonical constraints on characters, relationships, drives/neglect, and
epistemic/commitment models. It binds Discovery, Planning, Runtime, SMI, Validation, and Rendering.

Canon is immutable during a scene window. Do not use diagnostic scalars to override explicit canon
prohibitions.

2. Character canon (behavioral constraints)
CharacterCanon binds what a character can plausibly do/say. Generic voice is invalid when
CharacterCanon is present.

2.1 CharacterCanon schema (minimum)
CharacterCanon {
 character_id: string,
 display_name: string,
 role_function: string|null,

 voice_markers: [string...], # slang, cadence, tells, recurring moves
 default_tactics: [string...],
 taboos: [string...], # hard prohibitions
 soft_limits: [string...], # "will do only if..."
 vulnerabilities: [string...],

 goals_near_term: [string...],
 fears: [string...],
 violence_boundary: enum(A,B,C),

 notes: string|null
}

3. Relationship canon (axes + baseline)
Relationships are represented as:
- a baseline statement (what is true going into the scene),
- conceptual axes vocabulary (qualitative),
- optional numeric scalars (diagnostic only).

3.1 RelationshipEntry schema
RelationshipEntry {
 from_id: string,
 to_id: string,
 baseline: string,
 conceptual_axes: [string...], # e.g., ["power", "trust", "dependency"]
 scalars: {
 power: int|UNKNOWN, # 0–100 (diagnostic)
 trust: int|UNKNOWN,
 closeness: int|UNKNOWN,
 volatility: int|UNKNOWN
 },
 notes: string|null
}

3.2 Suggested axis vocabulary (non-exhaustive)
power / status / leverage
trust / suspicion
closeness / distance
dependency / autonomy
respect / contempt
fear / safety
volatility / stability
obligation / resentment

4. Drives and neglect (GCP)
Drives create pressure; neglect creates brittleness. Drives and neglect are used to generate plausible
pressure moves and costs.

4.1 DriveEntry schema
DriveEntry {
 character_id: string,
 drive_name: string,
 drive_pressure: int|UNKNOWN, # diagnostic 0–100
 neglect: int|UNKNOWN, # diagnostic 0–100
 justification: string|null
}

5. Truth, belief, and evidence (epistemic model)
Beliefs must be supported by in-scene evidence when they change. Truth-claims in a scene should be
tracked as belief deltas (INURecords) rather than exposition.

5.1 BeliefEvidenceEntry schema (optional)
BeliefEvidenceEntry {
 subject_id: string, # who holds the belief
 proposition: string,
 belief_strength: int|UNKNOWN, # diagnostic
 evidence: [ { kind:string, anchor:string, note:string } ... ],
 contradictions: [string...],
 notes: string|null
}

6. Commitment under uncertainty (CUU)
Commitments can be conditional, reluctant, or strategic. Commitment changes must be modeled as
INUs (commitment delta_type) with visible cost when high.

6.1 CommitmentEntry schema (optional)
CommitmentEntry {
 subject_id: string,
 commitment: string,
 strength: int|UNKNOWN,
 conditions: [string...],
 escape_hatches: [string...],
 notes: string|null
}

7. CanonInitializationPack (scene_local) — complete schema
CanonInitializationPack {
 scope: "scene_local",
 characters: [CharacterCanon...],
 relationships: [RelationshipEntry...],
 drives: [DriveEntry...],
 epistemics: [BeliefEvidenceEntry...]|null,
 commitments: [CommitmentEntry...]|null,
 notes: string|null
}

8. Canon rules (hard)
- Canon is immutable during a scene window.
- Phase -1 may create minimal scene_local canon only when required.
- Canon fields must be testable constraints, not analysis essays.
- Avoid psychological labels in rendered output unless required by story world and permitted by output
mode.
